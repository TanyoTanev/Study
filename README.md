# Study
1.Some solved tasks from SoftUni - from Python Advanced and Python Fundamentals courses (Fund_Text - 09.Rage quit.py and Fund_Text - 10.Winning Ticket.py).

2.The MATLAB files - multiple linear regression models for PhD articles, published in IEEE conferences. The code could be more clean. The accuracy of the model 
 and the conference deadline affected that 
 (PVModel2.m - multiple linear regression model for photovoltaic inverter;
  Report_20140609_Charge_and_Discharge.m - multiple linear regression model for a battery storage system in PV power plant;
  plot_data.m - ploting and extraction function for the battery model. The model data is the daily data for year (1 record on every 5 minutes).
